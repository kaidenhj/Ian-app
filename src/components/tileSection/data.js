    "I navigate the intersection of architecture, design, and technology to create functional and inspiring spaces. My passion lies in blending technical skills with creative problem-solving to shape environments that are both innovative and sustainable. I'm an architecture student with a strong foundation in design principles, drafting, and 3D modeling. My experience includes working with tools like AutoCAD, Revit, Rhino, and SketchUp to bring ideas to life. Whether itâ€™s urban planning, sustainable architecture, or digital fabrication, I love tackling challenges that push me to think critically and creatively. Beyond design, I find inspiration in nature, research, and collaboration. I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with materials, and discovering ways to merge architecture with environmental responsibility. One day, I hope to contribute to projects that redefine how we interact with and shape the built environment. ",
